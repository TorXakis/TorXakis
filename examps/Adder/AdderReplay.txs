    -- Process `replayProc` will be generated by running TorXakis with the
    -- `Adder` model and the SUT, as follows:
    --
    -- > tester Adder Sut
    -- > test 10
    -- > trace purp $> AdderPurpose.txs
    -- > exit
    --
    -- Therefore this file should be loaded together with the generated purpose
    -- above (`AdderPurpose.txs`).
