Command Line Interface
======================

``TorXakis`` ships with a command line interface.

To see the available commands type ``help`` on the ``TorXakis`` prompt.

History
-------

Command history can be navigated with the up and down arrows, or using
``Ctrl-P`` and ``Ctrl-N``.

To reverse-search in the command history type ``Ctrl+R``.

The command history is kept in the user's home directory (whose location varies
depending on the operating system), in a file called:

.. code-block:: text
                
  .torxakis-hist.txt
