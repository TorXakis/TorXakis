\section{Introduction}

An LPE may contain \istep{} summands: summands that communicate exclusively over the \istep{} channel.
This indicates an invisible action of the LPE.

The \texttt{istepelm} command removes \istep{} summands from an LPE at the cost of additional summands.
The resulting LPE preserves the behavior of the original LPE only up to weak (branching?) bisimulation.

Removing \istep{} may make exploration of the LPE more efficient, especially when the LPE contains \istep{} loops.

\section{Implementation}

TODO I do not believe that there is a viable implementation anymore...!
