# TorXakis

`TorXakis` is a tool for Model Based Testing.

It is licensed under the [BSD3 license](LICENSE).

## For Users
User documentation at [our wiki](https://github.com/TorXakis/TorXakis/wiki).

## Installation

### Windows
For Windows systems an installer is provided in the [releases][13] section.

### Linux

We provide a `deb` package from Debian based systems (Debian, Ubuntu, etc), and an
`rpm` package for distros using the RPM package manager. Below we give
instructions on how to install `TorXakis` on Ubuntu.

Download the latest `deb` release of `TorXakis` (`torxakis_0.6.0_amd64.deb` in
the example below) and then run the following commands:

```sh
apt-get update
apt-get install ./torxakis_0.6.0_amd64.deb -y
```

The `deb` package was tested on Ubuntu version `16.04`, `17.10`, and `18.04`.

For installing `TorXakis` in RPM based distros please check your Linux distro
manual.

### macOS ###

For macOS systems we provide a homebrew package. To install `TorXakis` run:

```sh
brew tap torxakis/torxakis
brew install torxakis
```

For more detailed instructions see the [Homebrew tap for
TorXakis](https://github.com/TorXakis/homebrew-TorXakis).

## For Developers

TorXakis is written in [Haskell](https://www.haskell.org) and
uses [`stack`][9] as build tool. In addition
TorXakis needs an [SMT][1] solver, such as [cvc4][2] or [Z3][3]. The SMT Solver
needs to support [SMTLIB][4] version 2.5, [Algebraic Data Types][5] (as
proposed for version 2.6), and [Strings][6]. The SMT Solvers are assumed to be
located on the [PATH][7]. For development acceptance tests [javac][8] is needed.

The Haddock documentation is also
available [here](https://torxakis.github.io/TorXakis/doc/index.html).

### Building

Make sure that [`stack`][10] is installed, then clone this repository.
`TorXakis` requires a `stack` version `1.6.1` or greater. To build and install
`TorXakis` locally, if you are on a Windows system run:

```sh
stack setup
stack install
```

For Unix systems a different stack configuration is used:

```sh
stack setup --stack-yaml stack_linux.yaml
stack install --stack-yaml stack_linux.yaml
```

The reason for having two configuration files is that on Windows systems the
libraries are linked statically, and thus we cannot use the `integer-gmp`
library, since `TorXakis` is licensed under the [BSD3 license](LICENSE).

In the instructions that follow we will omit the `--stack-yaml
stack-linux.yaml` flag, but bear in mind that if you're in an Unix system you
need to add it (or set the `STACK_YAML` environment variable to
"stack-linux.yaml")

If you experience problems when building from source, sometimes this could be
due to Makefiles which do not handle parallel builds well. If problems appear
while building, try setting the `MAKEFLAGS` variable to `" -j1 "` before
running the build commands. For instance on Unix systems this can be achieved
by running:

```sh
export MAKEFLAGS=" -j1 "
stack setup
stack install 
```

Note that the `MAKEFLAGS` variable does not affect the parallelism within
`stack` itself.

### Testing

When submitting a pull request, our continuous integration process will run a
series of tests. There are two levels of tests that we use in `TorXakis`:
unit-tests and integration tests. Unit-tests can be run when building using
`stack` by passing this `--test` flag:

```sh
stack install --test
```

To run the integration tests go to the `test/sqatt` folder, and run:

```sh
stack test
```

See the [README](test/sqatt/README.md) in the `sqatt` folder for more
information.

### Benchmarking

It is important to keep an eye on the performance of `TorXakis`. Currently
there is no continuous benchmarking process in place, however you can check
locally the performance by running the benchmarks for the (current) `develop`
version, and the version that you are working on. To run the benchmarks and
generate the reports on Unix systems you can run:

```sh
cd test/sqatt
stack bench --ba "--output  `date +%s`-report-`git rev-parse HEAD`.html --csv `date +%s`-report-`git rev-parse HEAD`.csv"
```

On Windows PowerShell you can run:

```posh
cd test\sqatt
stack bench --ba "--output
$(get-date).ToString("yyyyMMdd-hhmmss")-report-$((git rev-parse
HEAD).Substring(0,8)).html --csv $(get-date).ToString("yyyyMMdd-hhmmss")-report-$((git rev-parse HEAD).Substring(0,8)).csv"
```

See the [README](test/sqatt/README.md) in the `sqatt` folder for more
information.


### Repository structure

There are several folders in this repository, which serve different purposes:

- [`bin`](bin/): utility scripts to start `TorXakis` UI and server.
- [`ci`](ci/): scripts used in our continuous integration process.
- [`ci/mk-package`](ci/mk-package): files needed to create Linux packages.
- [`docs`](docs/): documentation files for `TorXakis`.
- [`examps`](examps/): example models and systems-under-test (SUT's) to play
  around with. This folder also contains some binary (.jpg and .pptx) files,
  which are used for documentation. Such files are tracked with [Git-LFS][15](*).
- [`sys`](sys/): packages that make up `TorXakis` this is where the source code
  resides.
- [`test`](test/): utilities for quality assurance tests (integration-tests,
  license-checking, etc).

See the README files in each folders to get a more detailed explanation.

(*): Git-LFS is installed by default along with official git client, so you should
     be able to access these files without extra effort. If, for some reason, you
     don't have Git-LFS, then you can [install the official Git-LFS extension][15].
